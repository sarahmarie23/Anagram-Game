# Cryptogram-Game

I enjoy solving number and word puzzles, and one type that I particularly like is cryptograms. In a cryptogram, you are given a sentence, often a famous quote, and each letter is replaced by another letter. You have to decipher the code and reveal the original sentence.

At a minimum, my cryptogram game will be able to:
  - [] Randomly select a sentence from a list of premade sentences
  - [] Shuffle the letters to be used as a key (the key is different for each round of the game)
  - [] Display the decoded sentence with blanks above each letter
  - [] The user guesses a letter, the game states if it is correct or not
  - [] If it is correct, it replaces the blanks above the corresponding letter with that letter
  - [] When the cryptogram has been solved, display a congradulatory message, asking if the user would like to play again
  
Features that would be nice to have
  - [] The user can type their own sentence to be added to the list
  - [] If you are in the middle of a game, save your work and reopen it
  - [] Try out a letter without making an official guess. It would need to be displayed in a different color
  - [] Clear the console so you only see one output at a time
